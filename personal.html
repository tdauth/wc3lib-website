	<h2>Interests</h2>
	<p>
		Like many other people (hopefully) I am interested in various things. The following list gives you an overview about my primary interests:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Game modifications primarily for the games Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne, Gothic II, GTA San Andreas Multiplayer but also for old classics like Age of Empires II, Age of Mythology, Delta Force Black Hawk Down etc.</li>
		<li>Programming: My favorite programming language is C++ or as some people call it C/C++ but I've also used Java, Go, Ruby, Scala and others as well as scripting languages for computer games such as JASS and vJass and more well known scripting languages as Bash.</li>
		<li>GNU/Linux: My current distribution is Gentoo Linux.</li>
		<li>Voice Acting: I've recorded many dialogues for the Gothic II modification Odyssee and would like to continue voice acting for other projects.</li>
		<li>Acting: I've got the leading part in the short movie Fresher and played some minor roles in a students theatre. I would like to continue acting as well, so if you have a movie or theatre project and you need another actor, feel free to contact me.</li>
		<li>Movie Creation: The whole process of movie creation is quite interesting. I made some minor short movies and I watch a lot of movies, so I am basically interested in creating a movie all the time.</li>
		<li>Story Creation: For The Power of Fire I wrote many quests, dialogues and a background story. It does not depend on the medium actually but creating a great story is always fun and entertains people.</li>
	</ul>
